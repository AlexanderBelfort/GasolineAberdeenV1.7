# GasolineAberdeenV1.7

Research indicates that the number of vehicles is increasing and so is the use
of prominent computer technology. It is our goal to use that knowledge and design a
mobile application that is aimed at solving the problem of needing to get somewhere
for the best price possible. We trust Gasoline Aberdeen to be a convenient way to
decrease costs or save time for our userbase.
